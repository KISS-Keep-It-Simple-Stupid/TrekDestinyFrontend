## Overview
This project is a travel platform web application developed as part of the Software Engineering course. The application enables users to travel for free by connecting travelers (guests) with local hosts. Guests can make announcements for their trips, and hosts can accept these announcements to invite guests to stay at their homes. The platform includes user authentication, user panels for guests and hosts, real-time chat and notifications, a blog section, and a comprehensive profile section.
